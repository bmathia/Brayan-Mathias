Project Institution - Built using Python Programming Language &amp; Django Framework. 
This is my first web project developed which can help an institution admin to post daily events, update staff data with profile pictures.
It also helps user admin to upload pictures and display as Photo gallery.
User admin can also edit/update/delete files after login using superuser credentials.
